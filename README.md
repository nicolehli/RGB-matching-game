# RGB_matching_game
A colour matching game for user to understand RGB (red, green, blue) model by matching the right RBG value to the right coloured tile.

### What I Did
- [x] game.html - the title, game tiles and general layout was created
- [x] game.js - the functions to match game tiles to a randomly picked solution style was added, added Easy Mode (3 Tiles game) and Hard Mode (6 Tiles game) and practiced callback functions
- [x] game.css - added styling and made sure Easy and Hard mode displays right number of tiles
- [x] refactored code
